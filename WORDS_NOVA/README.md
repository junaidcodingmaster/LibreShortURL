# WORDS-NOVA

A random, human-readable, and optimized word generator.

---

### Description:

This script implements the **WORDS-NOVA** algorithm — a lightweight and efficient method for generating pronounceable, pseudo-random words. It does this by alternating between consonants and vowels to produce words that are easier to read and pronounce. Optionally, a specified number of random digits can be appended to the end of the word to increase uniqueness.

The algorithm is designed with a very low collision probability (approximately 1 in 2.5 trillion), making it suitable for generating user-friendly identifiers, product keys, referral codes, and more.

### 📢 Announcement:

Hey developers and User or others!  
Feel free to use and remix the **WORDS-NOVA** algorithm to create something awesome—or even better!
Fork it, tweak it, and share what you build.

## Algorithm (Pseudocode)

```plaintext
FUNCTION GenerateRandomWord(length = 10, add_number_digits = 4)

    SET vowels ← "aeiou"
    SET consonants ← "bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz"

    IF length ≤ 0 THEN
        RETURN ""

    INITIALIZE word_chars AS empty list

    SET use_consonant ← randomly choose TRUE or FALSE

    FOR i FROM 0 TO length - 1 DO
        IF use_consonant THEN
            SET char ← randomly choose a character from consonants
        ELSE
            SET char ← randomly choose a character from vowels
        END IF

        APPEND char TO word_chars
        SET use_consonant ← NOT use_consonant
    END FOR

    SET word ← concatenate all characters in word_chars

    IF add_number_digits > 0 THEN
        INITIALIZE digits AS empty string
        FOR i FROM 0 TO add_number_digits - 1 DO
            APPEND a random digit from "0123456789" TO digits
        END FOR
        RETURN word + digits
    ELSE
        RETURN word
    END IF

END FUNCTION
```
